# Getting Started
Have the team leader fork this repository.

## 1. First Collaborator (**Team Leader**):
Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner to **fork** this repository. This creates a full copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
Within your forked repository, click the **"Branch"** dropdown, type a new branch name (e.g., feature-a), and press Enter to create and switch to this new branch.

## 2. Second Fork and Collaborator (**Person 2**):
Navigate to Team Leader's forked repository.
Click the "Fork" button. This creates a fork of the Team Leader's fork under Person 2's GitHub account, including the feature-a branch.
Within your forked repository, ensure you are on the feature-a branch (it should be the default if they forked from the Team Leader's feature-a branch).

## 3. Edit The File
Navigate to the sys_stats.sh file within this new branch, click the **"Edit"** (pencil) icon, make your changes, and **"Commit"** changes.
Commit your changes to the sys_stats.sh file in your own branch.

## 4. Merging Changes:
Person 2 (Merging into Person 1's Fork):
In Person 2's forked repository, navigate to the feature-a branch.
Click the **"Contribute"** dropdown and select **"Open pull request."**
Ensure the base repository is the Team Leader's fork and the base branch is feature-a. The head repository is Person 2's fork and the head branch is feature-a.
Create the pull request. The Team Leader will then review and merge this pull request into their feature-a branch.

Then each of your team members should fork the Team Leader's repository, so that each of you have your own copy of the repository.
5. Follow the directions in the comments of the sys_stats.sh file.
6. Use the Pi_System_Script.pdf file, which contains a list of commands that can be used to produce results for each task in the sys_stats.sh file.

## 5. Running and Testing the Script
1. The Team Leader should copy the sys_stats.sh file to the Raspberry Pi.
2. Change the permissions to make the file executable.
3. Run the script

## 6. Demonstrate for Credit
1. Demonstrate to me that your script runs as expected.
2. Show me the history of commits and pull requests in your branch.
